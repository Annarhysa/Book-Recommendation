# Book Recommendation System

Recommendation engines are a subclass of machine learning which generally deal with ranking or rating products / users. Loosely defined, a recommender system is a system which predicts ratings a user might give to a specific item. These predictions will then be ranked and returned back to the user.
Exploring recommendation systems through Books and Python

I have created this repository to build a Hybrid Recommendation System using the following:

### a) Collaborative Filtering System <br>
This recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.

### b) Content Based Filtering System <br>
It is supervised machine learning used to induce a classifier to discriminate between interesting and uninteresting items for the user.
